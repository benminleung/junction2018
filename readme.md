> Electrifying the local grid! - Pikachuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuu!

Operating a local electricity grid is becoming more challenging every day. The Electrification of heating and mobility is putting additional stress on our grid. Electric heat pumps are becoming more and more popular all over the world. Ever more electric vehicles are sold every year and need to be charged everyday. Proud EV owners arriving home from work all together, plugging in their cars create loads on the local grids, which are not suitable for the installed hardware in form of power lines and transformers.
This creates an increasing need for expensive investments in the local grid infrastructure... or does it?

## Reducing investment costs of distribution grids utilizing Smart Adaptive Demand Response
Demand Response has been widely known as a concept to balance renewable based electricity production in the transmission grid. Though until today the need for demand response on this scale of the grid has stayed low, because of the size of the transmission grid itself and the comparably low amount of fluctuating production in the total grid.
But independently from the growing share of renewable energies in our grid, another part of the grid will be pushed to it's limit just by the peak load of current and future electrified devices: local distribution grids.
Electrified mobility and heating will add up in measurable higher peak loads on the distribution grids which are becoming a bottleneck for electrification. To cover these uncontrolled peak loads it is necessary to upgrade transformers and even power lines in some cases. This results in very high investment costs for the distribution grid operator.
Our projekt "PEAKachu" is able to prevent this from happening for most grids. By connecting EV charging stations and electrical heating through the internet of things, we are able to coordinate all important single loads in the local grid.
Key piece of this system is a intelligent cloud hub at which the data from EV chargers and smart thermostats is collected.
