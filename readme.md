> Electrifying the local grid! - Pikachuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuu!

Operating a local electricity grid is becoming more challenging every day. The Electrification of heating and mobility is putting additional stress on our grid. Electric heat pumps are becoming more and more popular all over the world. Ever more electric vehicles are sold every year and need to be charged everyday. Proud EV owners arriving home from work all together, plugging in their cars create loads on the local grids, which are not suitable for the installed hardware in form of power lines and transformers.
This creates an increasing need for expensive investments in the local grid infrastructure... or does it?
